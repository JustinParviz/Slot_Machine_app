// function deposit() {
// 
// }

// - The ES6 style of writing a function involves writing a variable:
// - The example above works the exact same way as the example below

// const deposit = () => {
    
// }



// - The code below imports and allows you to use the package that was installed 
// called Prompt Sync.

// const prompt = require("prompt-sync")();

// NOTE: The Prompt Sync package gets the user input.
// - Adding another set of parenthesis at the end will require this package / module that 
// you're using, which kind of imports it into the program, to give you access to a function 
// that you can use to get the user input when you call it with these parenthesis.



// NOTE: The parseFloat function is just going to take a string and it's going convert it into its 
// floating point value.
// - If you have a string that is not a number, a string like "hello", and you use the parseFloat 
// function its going to give you something called NaN, which stands for Not a Number.
// - If you get NaN, that means that the user didn't enter a valid deposit amount and you need to 
// ask them to do that again. Or they can just quit the program and they would have to try again.
// - isNaN is a function that checks if something is not a number.



// - It's typically a practice for any of your global variables that are constants to be written in 
// all capitals
// - Snake Case uses an underscore as a space separator and all capitals as it's convention
//      EXAMPLE from project.js: SYMBOLS_COUNT



// - The spin function in the project.js file takes all of the possible symbols that can be used inside 
// of a list (array) and then it randomly selects them out of the array and removes them from the array 
// every single time that you use them while you're generating each reel (each individual column).
// - The symbols const is an empty array inside the spin function and it is used to generate an array 
// that contains all of the possible symbols that you can have.



// NOTE: An array, in JavaScript, is what's known as a reference data type, which means that you can manipulate 
// what's inside of the array without changing the reference to the array itself.
